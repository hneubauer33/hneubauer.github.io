		<h1>Barbara Jones-Hugo Exhibit: AfriCOBRA </h1>
		<p class = "content">
		Barbara Jones-Hogu was devoted to creating art that gave power and inspiration to African Americans. She co-founded the group AfriCOBRA (African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists) in 1968 alongside Jeff Donaldson, Wadsworth Jarrell, and Gerald Williams. AfriCOBRA was a collection of artists who produced work aimed to uplift African Americans through a positive aesthetic. In order to bring about that change during the civil rights movement, the group needed to expand their influence. Jones-Hogu’s skills as a printmaker were necessary for the mission of the group because it allowed for accessible and affordable art. Her prints illuminated the need for Black beauty and love during a time filled with racism and injustice. Pieces like “When Styling” (1970) and “Relate to Your Heritage” (1970) utilized images of confident African Americans dressed in both traditional and new African outfits. These prints express the idea that African Americans should embody the pride they feel for their heritage starting with how they dress. Other pieces like the famous “Unite” (1969) and “Rise and Take Control” (1970) call for action amongst the African American community during a time of revolution. David Lusenhop, Jones-Hogu’s art dealer states that “she wanted to be known as someone who supported the physical, spiritual, and intellectual liberation of black people around the world and that’s how she put it.” Through this online exhibition, we will be looking at Jones-Hogu’s prints during her days in AfriCOBRA and analyzing the formal, iconographical, contextual, and semiotic meanings of her work.
